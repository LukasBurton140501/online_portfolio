        <h1>Modeling</h1>
        <p>When creating games I always mae most of the assets that are featured to do this i need to use different software to create the assests that will be used. </p>
        <h1>Autodesk Maya</h1>
        <p>when creating 3D Models I always use Autodesk Maya as i have the most experience on the software and i realy like how it functions. personally I think Maya is increadible and i can only find fault in its tendencys to crash when creating and editing UV shells.</p> 
        <h1>3DS Max</h1>
        <p>I have learned how to use 3DS Max however i find Maya to be so much more efficent compared to Max because of this fact i prefer maya and rarly use this program. </p>
        <h1>Photoshop</h1>
        <p>I use photoshop to create the textures that will be placed on my Models however i often have the most issues at this stage due to hidden polygons or the modeling software just not wanting to function with photoshop. </p>
